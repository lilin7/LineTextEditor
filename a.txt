1 Do not pass objects to functions by value;
2 if the objects handle dynamic memory (i.e., heap memory)
3 do not ever pass objects to functions by value;
4 instead pass by reference, or even better, pass by const reference. 
5But if you must pass an object by value, 
6make sure that the class of that object defines 
7a copy constructor, 
8a copy assignment operator, 
9and a destructor. 
10That's called "the rule of three", or "the big three",
11and is emphasized in the C++ literature over and over and over again!
12To optimize performance, C++11 introduced
13move constructor,  and 
14move assignment operator.
15As a result, we must now follow "the rule of five" in C++.
